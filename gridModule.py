# GRID MODULE BY TIM
#This module contains 5 classes (grid, menu, pixelArt, pixel,colorPallet)
#the grid class is the abstract/parent class, the pixelArt and menu class inherit from it.(they are childs)
#The color pallet class inherits from pixel art class as they both use similar methods.
#The pixel art and colorPallet class creates pixel objects to
#populate the grid, therfore they are dependant of pixel.
#------------------------------------------------------
#Class Descriptions are given above each class.

#This class is capable of creating a grid containing different rows and different columns, bases upon those arguments it
#will automatically alter the pixel size. To display the grid simply call ____.drawGrid(). To find the item in the grid
#that was clicked on call ____.clicked().
